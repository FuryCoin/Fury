## Compiling Fury from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A
few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as
"Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system,
and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on
the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored
sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution
packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static
library archives (`.a`).

[^] On Debian/Ubuntu `libgtest-dev` only includes sources and headers. You must
build the library binary manually. This can be done with the following command ```sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev && cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make && sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/ ```

Debian / Ubuntu one liner for all dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev doxygen graphviz libpcsclite-dev libpgm-dev

### Cloning the repository

$ git clone https://github.com/FuryCoin/Fury

### Build instructions

Fury uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](Makefile) that
invokes cmake commands as needed.

#### On Linux and OS X

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory and build:

        cd Fury
        make

    *Optional*: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable
    parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For
    this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM
    available per thread.

    *Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from
    https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Fury/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Fury with `fury --detach`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:

        make release-test

    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:

         make debug

* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:

         make release-static

Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):

        HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile

#### On Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](http://msys2.github.io). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](http://msys2.github.io), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4
* Open the MingW shell via `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.
* Update packages again using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  


* Install dependencies:

    To build for 64-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium 

    To build for 32-bit Windows:
 
        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium
 
* Install git:

      pacman -S git 

* Clone the Repository:

      git clone https://github.com/FuryCoin/Fury 

**Building**

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

        cd Fury
        make release-static-win64

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

        cd Fury
        make release-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

### Building portable statically linked binaries

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:

* ```make release-static-linux-x86_64``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-i686``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv8``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv7``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv6``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
* ```make release-static-win64``` builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
* ```make release-static-win32``` builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems

## Running furyd

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in
foreground:

    ./bin/furyd

To list all available options, run `./bin/furyd --help`.  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
`--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

    ./bin/furyd --log-file furyd.log --detach

To run as a systemd service, copy
[furyd.service](utils/systemd/furyd.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
[furyd.conf](utils/conf/furyd.conf) to `/etc/`. The [example
service](utils/systemd/furyd.service) assumes that the user `fury` exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](utils/conf/furyd.conf).

If you're on Mac, you may need to add the `--max-concurrency 1` option to
monero-wallet-cli, and possibly monerod, if you get crashes refreshing.
